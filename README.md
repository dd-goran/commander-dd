# DD_COMMANDER

DD_COMMANDER is a basic, terminal-based file manager interface built with Python and the `prompt_toolkit` library. This project is primarily intended for educational purposes, demonstrating how to set up a simple dual-pane UI for file system navigation.

## Current Status and Purpose

This project is currently a minimal implementation intended for educational purposes. Its main features are:

1. Reading and displaying the contents of its current directory
2. Setting up a basic dual-pane UI
3. Allowing users to switch between panels
4. Enabling scrolling through files with up and down keys

It is not a fully functional file manager, but rather a starting point for learning about building terminal user interfaces and basic file system interactions in Python.

## Features

In its current state, you can:
- View the contents of the current directory in two panels
- Switch focus between the left and right panels using the Tab key
- Scroll through the list of files in each panel using the Up and Down arrow keys

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed
2. Run the script from the command line
3. Use the Tab key to switch between panels
4. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to scroll through files
5. Press F10 to exit the application

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates:
- How to use the `prompt_toolkit` library to create a terminal UI
- Basic file system operations in Python (listing directory contents)
- Implementing a dual-pane interface
- Handling keyboard input in a terminal application

## Future Development

While the current version is intentionally minimal, I am planning further development of this project. As new features and improvements are implemented, they will be pushed to this repository. Stay tuned for updates that will expand the functionality and educational value of DD_COMMANDER!

## Development

This educational project is part of the broader development and learning initiatives at [DigiDen](https://www.digiden.dev). It serves as a starting point for exploring more complex file management and terminal-based user interfaces.

## Contributing

While the project is intentionally minimal for educational purposes, suggestions for improvements or expansions that maintain its educational focus are welcome. Feel free to fork the project and expand upon it for your own learning!
